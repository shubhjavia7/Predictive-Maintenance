# Predictive-Maintenance

This project aims to explore advanced machine-learning techniques in Predictive Maintenance. I have taken a synthetic dataset from the UC Berkley library that represents real-world data. We aimed to explore two main problems with this data: predicting whether a machine will fail and classifying the reason for failure. We trained multiple different classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree classifier, bagging classifier, and XGBoost classifier. The primary metric for our problem was Recall because we aim to minimize false negatives.

I have compiled a full report on my analysis, methodology, and source code. Feel free to contact me if you have any feedback or questions.
