# Predictive-Maintenance

This project aims to explore advanced machine learning techniques in the field of Predictive Maintenance. I have taken a synthetic dataset from the UC Berkley library that represents real world data. We aimed at exploring two main problems with this data: Predicting whether a machine will fail or not and classifying the reason for failure. We trained multiple different classification models like logistic regression, decision tree classifier, bagging classifier, and XGBoost classifier. The primary metric for our problem was Recall because we aim to minimize false negatives.
